Two sub-folders in ormNode:
 - 1basicNotes
 - 2Validations
 - 3CRUD

The basicNotes folder has all of the first section in "Using SQL ORM's with NodeJS".
It has a wee bit of the second as well, as there are configuration objects in the
movie.js file in ./db/movies - it was at this point that I realised there were too
many complications, and added an additional archiving step.
