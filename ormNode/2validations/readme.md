Two sub-folders in ormNode:
 - 1basicNotes
 - 2Validations
 - 3CRUD

The validations folder has all of the commments from basicNotes removed, and a certain
amount of code from app.js - basically, everything apart from the stuff in promise.all.
The idea is to have only the stuff in here that handles basic errors arising from trying
to store data that is invalid as set by the way you've configured the database.
