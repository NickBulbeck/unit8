Two folders in ormNode:
 - init
 - crud

 The init folder has all of the first two sections in "Using SQL ORM's with NodeJS".
  - On finishing the second section, the material is mv'd into here
 The crud folder has the material from the third section.
  - On starting the third section, the material is cp'd into here
  - Comments are removed
  - There will be a bit of work involved before we can start this!
